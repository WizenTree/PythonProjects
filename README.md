### TuteDude DataScience Course Repository

In this repository I am uploading all the Assignments and Projects that I have recieved as an Trainee in TuteDude

#### [Assignment 1](EMS.py)
- As an introduction to Python, I was told to built a Employee Management System that works on the CLI(Command Line Interface). The file is saved as an "__EMS.py__" in this folder.

#### [Assignment 2](Probability.ipynb)
- As an introduction to the Probability side of the data, I was given several tasks to perform in the python using __jupyter notebook__. This file is saved as an "__Probability.ipynb__" in this folder

#### [Assignment 3](Statistics.ipynb) 
- As an deep dive to the Statistics and Python using libraries such as "__statistics__", "__scipy__", "__sklearn__", and "__matplotlib__" I was given several tasks and question to complete. All the files are saved in the name "__Statistics.ipynb__" in this folder.

#### [Assignment 4](Assignment-4)
- As an deep dive into the advanced tools in python libraries like "__numpy__", "__pandas__", "__matplotlib__". I have created a seperated folder in this folder named "__Assignment-4__" in which all the files are their related to the libraries.

#### [Assignment 5](Maths_for_DS.py)
- As an deep diving into the maths behind the Probability, Statistics, and DataScience. I have created a file called "__Maths_for_DS.py__" in this folder.

#### [Assignment 6](neural-network-classifier)
- As an really deep divng into the machine learning aspects of python and learning how neural networks works and mine own understanding of it. I have created a folder named "__neural-network-classifier__". In this folder you will find the readme file and a very basic neural network that i have managed to make.

#### [Assignment 7](covid19-analysis)
- In this Project I was pre-assigned the dataset about covid 19 and was told to make an analysis based on the data. I have created the folder for this Case Study in the folder named "__covid19-analysis__". 

#### [Assignment 8](rainfall-prediction)
- In this Project I am using the pre-assigned dataset named austin-weather and I am using the Linear Regression model from sklearn to predict the rainfall patterns. I have created the folder named "__rainfall-prediction__" for the files related to dataset.

#### [Assignment 9](Tumor_Detection-project)
- In this project I am using the pre-assigned dataset named tumor_detection.csv and I am using the Random Forest Classifier from sklearn to detect whether a tumor is begining or malignant using machine learning techniques. I have created the folder named "__Tumor_Detection-project__" for the files.

#### [Assignment 10]([Employee_Performance_and_Retention_Analysis/Employee_Performance_and_Retention_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/WizenTree/TuteDude-DataScienceProjects/tree/920468acbe755fe1aa8bad73f215d8bad478d3af/Employee%20Performance%20and%20Retention%20Analysis))
- In this project I have started with creating the dataset since I couldn't find any dataset related to my task, to takle the task I have created a python script to help me generate a dataset . In the dataset I have done EDA and analysied the data using the machine learning and deep learning algorithms, and also visulalized the trends to help better understand the data . I have created a folder named "__Employee Performance and Retention Analysis__" for the files related to the project.
